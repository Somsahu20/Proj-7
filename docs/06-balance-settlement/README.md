## Core Concepts

### Balance
A user's balance in a group is the net amount:
- **Positive balance**: Others owe you money
- **Negative balance**: You owe money to others
- **Zero balance**: Settled up

### Settlement
The process of paying back what's owed to reach zero balance.

### Debt Simplification
Reducing the number of payments needed by optimizing who pays whom.
